# waterplants
This is an re-upload of the automatic irrigation system wish i made for my gymnasiearbetet/komvuxarbete.


For this project i used analog to digital converter from Adafruit_ADS1115. 
A 5V pump and relay with a wall ad/dc converter to power the pump.
but the pump could easily be changed with an water valve.


# TODO:
* Convert global varianbles to classes.
* Add away to describe the wiring better
* uppload the ardoino implementation and uppdate it
